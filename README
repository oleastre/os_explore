Simple minetest explorer.

When launched, it will teleport your player around a rectangular spiral
moving by 80 nodes at each steps; forcing mintest to generate map blocks.

At each jump, it will report you your new position and the size of the spiral 
(you are on a square 80*size nodes away from your start point).

Two chat commands are available:
/explore_map [stop_at_steps] : 
  where stop_at_steps is an optional number.
  Start exploring around the spiral; stopping after stop_at_steps steps if
  specified; otherwise, loop indefinitely.

/stop_explore :
  Stop current exploration and go back to starting point 
  (usefull if you started without specifying stop_at_steps)
