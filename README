===========

When launched, we force minetest to load the specified map blocks. If a block
does not exists, it will be automatically generated.

The following chat command is available:
/mapgen radius [max_height]:
  where radius is a number and max_height is an optional number
  This will ask minetest to load the square around you current player position,
  from position-radius to position+radius on the x and z axis; effectively
  creating a square of 2*radius.
  If you specify the max_height parameter, it will extrude the square to a box
  starting at your current player position height and ending at max_height.

  Once started, this can not be stopped (except by stopping the server); but it
  works asynchronously.
  Once started, it will report you for each generated block: the remaining
  blocks count to visit, elapsed time and last generated block position.
