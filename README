Simple minetest explorer.

License: CC0


This mods adds two exploration modes:
- emerge_area
- teleport

Emerge_area mode
================

When launched, we force minetest to load the specified map blocks. If a block
does not exists, it will be automatically generated.

The following chat command is available:
/mapgen radius [max_height]:
  where radius is a number and max_height is an optional number
  This will ask minetest to load the square around you current player position,
  from position-radius to position+radius on the x and z axis; effectively
  creating a square of 2*radius.
  If you specify the max_height parameter, it will extrude the square to a box
  starting at your current player position height and ending at max_height.

  Once started, this can not be stopped (except by stopping the server); but it 
  works asynchronously. 
  Once started, it will report you for each generated block: the remaining 
  blocks count to visit, elapsed time and last generated block position.

This mode is somewhat faster and more reliable than the teleport one.


Teleport mode
=============

When launched, it will teleport your player around a rectangular spiral
moving by 80 nodes at each steps; forcing mintest to generate map blocks.

At each jump, it will report you your new position and the size of the spiral 
(you are on a square 80*size nodes away from your start point).

Two chat commands are available:
/explore_map [stop_at_steps] : 
  where stop_at_steps is an optional number.
  Start exploring around the spiral; stopping after stop_at_steps steps if
  specified; otherwise, loop indefinitely.

/stop_explore :
  Stop current exploration and go back to starting point 
  (usefull if you started without specifying stop_at_steps)

If your server crashes because it can not keep generating blocks, you can 
increase the hard coded wait time in the mod's init.lua file.
